A normal distribution is a kind of data variation that is for natural differences in [[Individual|individuals]]. In order to assume a normal distribution for a set of data, **the mean of the set must be equal, or close to equal.** The closeness of these values depend on the context of the data #Important

## General Formula: $$\huge{f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \cdot\sqrt{2\pi}}\cdot e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}}$$
$\large\mu$ In this case refers to the mean or expectation of the distribution.
$\large\sigma$ Refers to the [[Standard Deviation]] of the distribution.
The [[Variance]] of a standard or normal distribution is $\large\sigma^2$.
