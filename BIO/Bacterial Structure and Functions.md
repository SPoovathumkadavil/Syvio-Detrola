Bacteria
Prokaryotic, cause health and disease, Live on skin and objects around us
Bacteria live within organisms as well. For example, our large intestine is a bacterial ecosystem with at least dozens of unique species taking residence.
Eukaryotic more complex
no nucleus or membrane bound organelles like Mitochondria, E. R., Golgi Complexes
Cell envolope - layers
cell wall - outer surface, protection, contains peptidoglycan (determines gram positive or gram negative) If peptidoglycan is above the plasma membrane, it can retain dye. Negative bacteria have thinner layer sandwiched between surface membrane and plasma membranes. These cant retain dye
"Gram staining"
