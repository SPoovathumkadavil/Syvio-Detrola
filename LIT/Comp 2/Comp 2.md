The 1920s were an interesting time of interesting people. Although people were torn from the effects of the first world war, the economy flourished. Young men, grown accustomed to the war, were concentrated on living in the present. The “Roaring 20s” were the result of the efforts of these radical youth to change society. Parties were commonplace, and many women went to them as well. The scarred youth laughed in the face of prohibition and drank in speakeasies. Fitzgerald relays these elements in his novel, The Great Gatsby. He describes the extent people would go to “have a good time”. He also explores many dark themes such as despair and disillusionment. Considering the setting as the epilogue of a war, it is inferred that many of these people have masks. That they drink and pretend to have fun in order to run away from the despicable nature of their thoughts. Fitzgerald uses elements of modernism such as symbolism, paralysis and the question of the relationship between the past and present to criticize the frivolousness of people in the 1920s.

The 1920s, also known as the "Roaring 20s," were a decade marked by significant cultural differences and change. As a result of World War I's devastation, people were ripped apart by its aftereffects, yet the economy was booming, providing a glimmer of prosperity. However, the radical young of this era, who were motivated to transform society and live life to the fullest, grabbed center stage. Parties became a common occurrence during the time, attracting both men and women, and the Prohibition restrictions were mocked by the era's irreverent attitude. In his book "The Great Gatsby," F. Scott Fitzgerald expertly captured the spirit of the moment by examining the lengths individuals would go to for a good time as well as the darker themes of despair and disillusionment that lay under the surface. In this essay, we will examine Fitzgerald's use of symbols, notably the green light, to represent Gatsby's immobility and fixation on the past as well as the continued applicability of his condemnation of frivolity in the 1920s and beyond.

Green lights are a reoccurring image in Fitzgerald's book that represent Gatsby's sense of stagnation and longing. This lamp, which is located at the end of Daisy's dock, acts as a beacon, warning Gatsby that Daisy is still out of reach as long as the lamp is on. He ties his physical separation from Daisy to his mental separation from her, as if the light itself holds the answer to their reconciliation. Gatsby goes to tremendous lengths—even asking Nick for assistance—to create scenarios that will bring the two of them together. Gatsby is nevertheless still troubled by the past while he is in Daisy's presence, despite all of his seeming greatness and triumphs. 

Gatsby's preoccupation with the past is not limited to his anxiety over rekindling his relationship with Daisy. The novel also portrays his anxiety about getting too close to her now. His overthinking of social interactions, despite hosting extravagant parties, mirrors the broader theme of introversion that permeates the novel. This is further reflected in the rumors surrounding him, which suggest a lack of concern for others' opinions. As Nick becomes aware of Gatsby's true intentions, he observes a marked change in Gatsby's behavior, particularly his excessive kindness towards him due to his role as Daisy's brother. This detachment from the present world prompts the question: why is Gatsby so consumed by his past and his pursuit of Daisy? In the eyes of many, he possesses everything one could desire, including immense wealth and Daisy's affection. Her admiring comment on his shirts exemplifies the scale of his wealth, yet it also underscores his doubts about impressing her. Gatsby's lavish lifestyle, in reality, serves as a facade, constructed solely to win Daisy's heart, highlighting the extent to which his obsession with the past has overtaken his present reality.

Fitzgerald's portrayal of the frivolousness of the 1920s in "The Great Gatsby" extends beyond its immediate context and continues to resonate with contemporary society. Today, as in the 1920s, people often seek various forms of entertainment and distraction, ranging from benign to hazardous, often without strong consideration of boundaries. The enduring significance of Gatsby's green light lies in its representation of unattainable desires. It serves as a reminder that not everything we pursue is as distant as it may seem, cautioning against becoming ensnared by our own past or unrealistic dreams.

In conclusion, F. Scott Fitzgerald's use of symbolism, particularly the green light, in "The Great Gatsby" offers a profound commentary on the dangers of fixating on the past and the allure of unattainable desires. Gatsby's yearning for a love that seems just out of reach serves as a cautionary tale for both the excesses of the 1920s and the enduring tendencies of human nature. The green light, like the frivolousness it represents, continues to beckon, reminding us that the pursuit of the unattainable can lead to stagnation, both in the Jazz Age and in our contemporary world.
