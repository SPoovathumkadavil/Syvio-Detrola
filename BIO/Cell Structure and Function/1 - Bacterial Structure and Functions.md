# [[Prokaryotic Cells]]

[[Prokaryotic Cells]] cause health and disease, and they live on skin and objects around us. [[Bacteria]] live within organisms as well. For example, our [[Large Intestine|large intestine]] is a bacterial ecosystem with at least dozens of unique species taking residence.

[[Prokaryotic Cells]] are less complex than [[Eukaryotic Cells]].
- They have no [[Nucleus|nucleus]] or membrane bound [[Organelles|organelles]] like [[Mitochondria]], [[Endoplasmic Reticulum|E. R.]], [[Golgi Complexes]]

There are 4 main shapes of Prokaryotic cells. These are formed by the [[Cell Wall]].
- [[Cocci]] - Round, almost spherical structures.
- [[Bacilli]] - Rod-like structures.
- [[Spirilla]] - Spiral or wavy structures.
- [[Pleomorphic]] - The same bacteria can take different shapes.

[[E-Coli]] are rod shaped [[Bacilli|bacilli]].

## [[Cell Envelope|The Cell Envelope]]
[[Cell Envelope]] - layers of the outer structure of the cell.
- [[Cell Wall]] - The outer surface of a prokaryote, acts as protection, contains [[Peptidoglycans|peptidoglycan]] (determines [[Gram Positive Bacteria|gram positive]] or [[Gram Negative Bacteria|gram negative]]). 
	- If [[Peptidoglycans|peptidoglycan]] is above the plasma membrane, it can retain dye. [[Gram Negative Bacteria|Negative bacteria]] have a thinner layer sandwiched between the [[Surface Membranes|surface membrane]] and [[Plasma Membranes|plasma membranes]]. These can't retain dye.
		- "[[Gram Staining]]"
- Some bacteria are covered by a [[Capsule|capsule]](outermost layer), these act as shields to adhere and protect.
	- The [[Capsule|bacterial capsule]] is also considered a [[Virulence Factor|virulence factor]] as it enhances the ability of bacteria to cause disease by preventing [[Phagocytosis|phagocytosis]].
		- [[Phagocytosis]] is often performed by white blood cells called [[Phagocytes|phagocytes]], cells that are part of [[Innate Immune System|the non-specific immune response]].
- The [[Plasma Membranes|plasma membrane]] is the innermost layer and most important. It contains [[Cytoplasm|cytoplasm]] which consists of water, cell components, [[Enzymes|enzymes]], and molecules. 
	- If there is no membrane, the contents of the cytoplasm will spill
	- The [[Plasma Membranes|plasma membrane]] is responsible for [[4 - Cell Communication and Cell Cycle|communication with the outside world]].
	- It is also responsible for acquiring nutrients, eliminating waste, and maintaining a constant organized state.
		- It is selectively permeable, helps with [[Cellular Respiration|cell respiration]], [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesis]], and synthesis of [[Lipids|lipids]] and cell components.
			- There are species of bacteria that perform [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesis]]. ALL [[Cells|cells]] perform a version of [[Cellular Respiration|cellular respiration]].

[[Ribosomes]] are the sites of [[Protein Synthesis|protein synthesis]]. If the ribosome is free in the [[Cytoplasm|cytoplasm]], then the [[Protein|proteins]] made will stay in the cell. Alternately, if the [[Ribosomes|ribosome]] is attached to the [[Plasma Membranes|plasma membrane]], the [[Protein|proteins]] made can stay in the the bacteria or travel out. This second type of ribosomes are called [[Plasma Membrane Associated Ribosomes|Plasma membrane associated ribosomes]].

The [[Nucleoid]] contains chromosomes, mostly [[Single Circle ds-DNA|single circle ds-DNA]]. Some can have linear structure and more than one chromosome.

[[Plasmids]] are small [[Double Stranded DNA|ds-DNA]] molecules that are independent. The [[DNA]] can be circular or linear. It only contains a few genes, but these are often genes that give the bacteria an advantage such as resistance to antibiotics.

[[Bacteria]] can more or attach itself to other surfaces. they have pili and fimbriae. They can also have flagella, a tail like thing for movement. 
While the fimbriae are bristle-like short fibers occurring on the bacterial surface, Pili are long hair-like tubular microfibers found on the surface of bacteria.
