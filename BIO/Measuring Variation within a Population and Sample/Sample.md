A sample is a specific set of [[Individual|individuals]] which are pulled out of a population. These are who you receive data from, and these are the representatives for the entire population.

It is good to note that although the samples are representatives for the bigger population, they may not contain every single variation. A good sample size or an ideal sample size would be equal to **30**.
