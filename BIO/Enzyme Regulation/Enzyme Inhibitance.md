## Review
Protein is folded chain of amino acids linked by peptide bonds.
Dehydration responsible for synthesis is endergonic.
The tertiary structure is caused by the side-groups of different amino acids.
These side groups can be acidic/basic (charged), polar, or non-polar.
A change in pH or temperature can affect these interactions leading to denaturation.

Denaturation is a continuum, can be relatively denatured.
