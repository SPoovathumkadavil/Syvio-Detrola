_"There is natural variation"_ - Charles Darwin

## What We Did
Take a [[Sample|sample]] of [[Individual|10 beans]] at random from a [[Population|population]], and we measure the [[Variable|lengths of the bean]].
This data was then collected on a class graph.

## What We Observed
The graph of the samples followed a [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution or a bell curve]]. It was even more apparent with the larger dataset of the whole class.

In order to get decently conclusive view of a population the minimum ideal sample size is **30**. #Important 
This is because a size of 30 is enough to see [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]]. This value is **not accurate, but representative.**

Keep in mind that we are not sampling for all attributes of a sample, only for one [[Variable|response]].

A [[Variable]] that is at the extremes(More than 2 [[Standard Deviation|STDEVs]] away) is a [[Mutant]] #Important
