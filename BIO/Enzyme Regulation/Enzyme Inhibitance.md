## Review
Protein is folded chain of amino acids linked by peptide bonds.
Dehydration responsible for synthesis is endergonic.
The tertiary structure is caused by the side-groups of different amino acids.
These side groups can be acidic/basic (charged), polar, or non-polar.
A change in pH or temperature can affect these interactions leading to denaturation.

Denaturation is a continuum, can be relatively denatured.

Charge-Charge interactions between enzyme and substrate
Polar-Polar: Hydrogen bonds form as a result of polar or partially polar parts of molecules.
Non polar Interactions.

Substrate: Ligands

More than one interaction available between enzyme and substrate.

Affinity: How well do the enzyme and substrate interact

A protein could bind to multiple types of substrates.

The substrate could conform to an enzyme such that a reaction could occur due to the catalysis by the enzyme.
