A chi-square test is a statistical test used to compare observed results with expected results. The purpose of this test is to determine if a difference between observed data and expected data is due to chance, or if it is due to a relationship between the variables you are studying. Therefore, a chi-square test is an excellent choice to help us better understand and interpret the relationship between our two categorical variables.
