- **Definition of Speciation**
    - Speciation is the process by which one ancestral species splits into two or more distinct species.
    - It involves the evolution of reproductive barriers that prevent gene flow between populations.

- **Types of Speciation**
    - **[[Allopatric Speciation]]**: Occurs when populations are geographically separated, leading to genetic isolation.
    - **[[Sympatric Speciation]]**: Occurs when new species evolve from a single ancestral species within the same geographic area.

- **Mechanisms of Speciation**
    - **Geographic Isolation**: Physical barriers (mountains, rivers, etc.) can separate populations, limiting their ability to interbreed.
    - **[[Reproductive Isolation]]**: Develops through mechanisms like behavioral differences, temporal isolation, and genetic incompatibility.

- **Evidence of Speciation**
    - **[[Evidence of Speciation in Fossil Record|Fossil Record]]**: Fossils can provide insights into the evolution and divergence of species over time.
    - **Comparative Anatomy**: Examining the anatomical features of related species can reveal evolutionary relationships.

- **Modes of Speciation**
    - **Gradualism**: Species gradually diverge over long periods through accumulated small changes.
    - **Punctuated Equilibrium**: Speciation occurs relatively quickly in short bursts of change.

- **Examples of Speciation**
    - **Darwin's Finches**: Different species of finches on the GalÃ¡pagos Islands evolved distinct beak shapes due to different diets.
    - **Hawaiian Honeycreepers**: Radiated into numerous species from a common ancestor in the Hawaiian Islands.

- **[[Human Induced Speciation]]**
    - **Human Activities**: Habitat destruction and fragmentation can lead to isolation and potentially new species.
    - **Artificial Selection**: Humans have selectively bred plants and animals, leading to rapid speciation.

- **[[Controversies on Speciation|Controversies and Debates]]**
    - The concept of speciation has led to debates about how to define and identify species. -> [[Species Concepts]]
    - Some argue that the process of speciation is more complex than traditionally thought.

- **Speciation and Evolution**
    - Speciation is a key driver of biodiversity and plays a crucial role in the theory of evolution by natural selection.
    - These mechanisms and modes influence the [[Speed of Speciation|speed of speciation]].
