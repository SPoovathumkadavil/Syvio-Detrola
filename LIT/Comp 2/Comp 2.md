The 1920s were an interesting time of interesting people. Although people were torn from the effects of the first world war, the economy flourished. Young men, grown accustomed to the war, were concentrated on living in the present. The “Roaring 20s” were the result of the efforts of these radical youth to change society. Parties were commonplace, and many women went to them as well. The scarred youth laughed in the face of prohibition and drank in speakeasies. Fitzgerald relays these elements in his novel, The Great Gatsby. He describes the extent people would go to “have a good time”. He also explores many dark themes such as despair and disillusionment. Considering the setting as the epilogue of a war, it is inferred that many of these people have masks. That they drink and pretend to have fun in order to run away from the despicable nature of their thoughts. Fitzgerald uses elements of modernism such as symbolism, paralysis and the question of the relationship between the past and present to criticize the frivolousness of people in the 1920s.

The 1920s, commonly referred to as the "Roaring 20s," stand as a decade defined by profound cultural shifts and societal transformations. Emerging from the ashes of World War I, the people of this era found themselves torn between the devastation of the past and the promise of economic prosperity. However, it was the radical youth of the time, driven by a desire to reshape society and live life to the fullest, who took center stage. Parties, once forbidden by Prohibition, became commonplace, drawing both men and women into the revelry of the era. F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, "The Great Gatsby," serves as a vivid portrayal of this period, capturing the extremes people went to for a good time while also delving into the darker undercurrents of despair and disillusionment that lurked beneath the surface. In this essay, we will explore Fitzgerald's use of symbols, particularly the green light, to represent Gatsby's immobilization in the past and his fixation on it. We will also discuss how Fitzgerald's critique of frivolity in the 1920s continues to resonate in modern times.

The motif of the green light recurs throughout Fitzgerald's novel, symbolizing Gatsby's sense of stagnation and unfulfilled longing. Positioned at the end of Daisy's dock, the green light serves as a symbolic beacon, a constant reminder to Gatsby that Daisy remains just out of reach as long as it continues to shine. Gatsby associates his physical separation from Daisy with his emotional distance from her, as if the light itself holds the key to their reconciliation. He goes to great lengths, even enlisting Nick's assistance, to engineer situations that will bring them back together. Yet, despite his outward achievements and opulence, Gatsby remains haunted by the past when he is in Daisy's presence, paralyzed by his own history. This underscores how even seemingly insignificant concerns from one's past can interfere with the present, impeding the efforts of even the most determined individuals.

Gatsby's fixation on the past extends beyond his concern for rekindling his romance with Daisy. The novel also portrays his anxiety about approaching her in the present. Despite hosting extravagant parties, Gatsby overanalyzes social interactions, reflecting a broader theme of introversion within the narrative. This introspection is further evidenced by the rumors surrounding him, suggesting a disregard for others' opinions. As Nick becomes aware of Gatsby's true intentions, he observes a marked change in Gatsby's behavior, particularly his excessive generosity toward him due to his status as Daisy's brother. This detachment from the present world prompts the question: why is Gatsby so consumed by his past and his pursuit of Daisy? In the eyes of many, he possesses everything one could desire, including immense wealth and Daisy's love. Her admiration for his shirts highlights his opulence, yet it also underscores his doubt in his ability to impress her. Gatsby's ostentatious lifestyle, in reality, is merely a façade constructed to win Daisy's affection, revealing the extent to which his fixation on the past has eclipsed his present reality.

Beyond its immediate historical context, Fitzgerald's depiction of the decadence of the 1920s in "The Great Gatsby" remains relevant in contemporary culture. Today, as in the 1920s, individuals often seek various forms of entertainment and diversion, from the benign to the hazardous, frequently without considering the boundaries. The enduring significance of Gatsby's green light lies in its representation of unfulfilled desires. It serves as a reminder that not everything we desire is as distant as it may seem, cautioning against becoming ensnared by our own past or unrealistic dreams.

In conclusion, F. Scott Fitzgerald's use of symbolism, particularly the green light, in "The Great Gatsby" offers a profound commentary on the dangers of fixating on the past and the allure of unattainable desires. Gatsby's yearning for a love that appears just out of reach serves as a cautionary tale for both the excesses of the 1920s and the enduring tendencies of human nature. The green light, like the frivolity it represents, continues to beckon, reminding us that the pursuit of the unattainable can lead to stagnation, both in the Jazz Age and in our modern world.
