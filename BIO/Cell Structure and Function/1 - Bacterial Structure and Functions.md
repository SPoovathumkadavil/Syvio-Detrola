# [[Prokaryotic Cells]]

[[Prokaryotic Cells]] cause health and disease, and they live on skin and objects around us. [[Bacteria]] live within organisms as well. For example, our [[Large Intestine|large intestine]] is a bacterial ecosystem with at least dozens of unique species taking residence.

[[Prokaryotic Cells]] are less complex than [[Eukaryotic Cells]].
- They have no [[Nucleus|nucleus]] or membrane bound [[Organelles|organelles]] like [[Mitochondria]], [[Endoplasmic Reticulum|E. R.]], [[Golgi Complexes]]

There are 4 main shapes of Prokaryotic cells. These are formed by the [[Cell Wall]].
- [[Cocci]] - Round, almost spherical structures.
- [[Bacilli]] - Rod-like structures.
- [[Spirilla]] - Spiral or wavy structures.
- [[Pleomorphic]] - The same bacteria can take different shapes.

[[E-Coli]] are rod shaped [[Bacilli|bacilli]].

## [[Cell Envelope|The Cell Envelope]]
[[Cell Envelope]] - layers of the outer structure of the cell.
- [[Cell Wall]] - The outer surface of a prokaryote, acts as protection, contains [[Peptidoglycans|peptidoglycan]] (determines [[Gram Positive Bacteria|gram positive]] or [[Gram Negative Bacteria|gram negative]]). 
	- If [[Peptidoglycans|peptidoglycan]] is above the plasma membrane, it can retain dye. [[Gram Negative Bacteria|Negative bacteria]] have a thinner layer sandwiched between the [[Surface Membranes|surface membrane]] and [[Plasma Membranes|plasma membranes]]. These can't retain dye.
		- "Gram staining"
- Some bacteria are covered by a [[Capsule|capsule]](outermost layer), these act as shields to adhere and protect.
	- The [[Capsule|bacterial capsule]] is also considered a [[Virulence Factor|virulence factor]] as it enhances the ability of bacteria to cause disease by preventing [[Phagocytosis|phagocytosis]].
		- [[Phagocytosis]] is often performed by white blood cells called [[Phagocytes|phagocytes]], cells that are part of [[Innate Immune System|the non-specific immune response]].
- The [[Plasma Membranes|plasma membrane]] is the innermost layer and most important. It contains [[Cytoplasm|cytoplasm]] which consists of water, cell components, [[Enzymes|enzymes]], and molecules. 
	- If there is no membrane, the contents of the cytoplasm will spill
	- The [[Plasma Membranes|plasma membrane]] is responsible for [[4 - Cell Communication and Cell Cycle|communication with the outside world]].
	- It is also responsible for acquiring nutrients, eliminating waste, and maintaining a constant organized state.
		- It is selectively permeable, helps with [[Cellular Respiration|cell respiration]], [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesis]], and synthesis of [[Lipids|lipids]] and cell components.
			- There are species of bacteria that perform [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesis]]. ALL [[Cells|cells]] perform a version of [[Cellular Respiration|cellular respiration]].




In cytoplasm there are ribosomes, sites of protein synthesis. if in cytoplasm free, Make proteins that stay in the cell, if attached on the plasma membrane, make proteins for cell and outside. The second kind is called Plasma membrane associated robosomes.
Nucleoid contains chromozomes, mostly single circle ds-DNA. Some can have linear & more than one chromosome. 
plasmids Small ds-DNA that are independant, Cna be circular or linear few genes, not nessesary, usually confer selective advantages such as resistance to antibiotics.
Bacteria can more or attach itself to other surfaces, they have pili, hair like surfaces, fimbriae(smaller hairs). Can have flagella, tail like thing for movement. ![[prokaryotic cell.jpg | center | 1000]]
