_A number response where the average makes sense_

Also known as Numerical Variables, these represent measurable quantities with a meaningful numerical ordering. Numerical variables can be further classified into two subtypes:

## **Discrete Variables:**
These variables take on distinct, separate values. Examples include the number of siblings, the count of items sold, or the number of cars in a parking lot.
## **Continuous Variables:** 
These variables can take on any value within a certain range and can be measured with great precision. Examples include height, weight, temperature, and age.
