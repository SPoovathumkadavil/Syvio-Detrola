Occurs mainly due to environmental factors, considered genetic drift.

The response explains that the population underwent a genetic bottleneck (i.e. genetic drift) and thus has reduced genetic diversity, which makes the current population more likely to be susceptible to a new disease than it would have been in the past.

The community will collapse or be destabilized.  
The population sizes of some species will increase and others will decrease.  
Species diversity of the community will decrease.

The response includes the justification that the prey species of the Tasmanian devil would have increased in number as the Tasmanian devil population decreased, likely leading to population decreases of the food sources for these prey species.

3 points maximum  
1. Describe effect [1 point]: Species C has had little or no effect on species A; however, as species C increases, B decreases. Both statements must be addressed in order to earn credit.  
2. Explanation for species A or dashed line [1 point]: No or little competition (i.e. no niche overlap).  
3. Explanation for species B or solid line [1 point]: Competition (i.e. niche overlap).  
4. Identification of the niche “Competitive Exclusion Principle” [1 point]: by name or description (Not required).
2 points maximum  
1. Prediction [1 point]: The population will increase, decrease, or stabilize (level off).  
2. Explanation [1 point]: Connect a correct explanation to the prediction.  
  
Increase—connect to abundant resources and freedom from competition.  
Decrease—connect to exhaustion of a key resource or density-dependent cause.  
Stabilize or level off—connect to the establish of the system's carrying capacity due to the presence of a limiting resource.
