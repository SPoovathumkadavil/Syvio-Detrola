## Domains of Life

The classification of life on Earth is organized into three major domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. These domains represent the highest level of biological classification and reflect fundamental differences in cell structure, genetics, and evolutionary history. Here's a detailed look at each domain:

1. **[[Bacteria]]**:
    - **Cell Type**: Bacteria are prokaryotic cells, meaning they lack a membrane-bound nucleus and other organelles.
    - **[[Cell Wall]]**: Most bacteria have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan.
    - **Metabolism**: Bacteria exhibit diverse metabolic pathways, including autotrophy ([[Photosynthesis|photosynthesis]]) and heterotrophy (consumption of organic matter).
    - **Habitats**: Bacteria inhabit a wide range of environments, from soil and water to extreme environments like hot springs and deep-sea hydrothermal vents.
    - **Reproduction**: Bacteria reproduce asexually through binary fission.

1. **Archaea**:
    - **Cell Type**: Archaea are also prokaryotic but differ from bacteria in cell membrane structure and genetic makeup.
    - **Cell Wall**: Archaea have diverse cell wall compositions, and many lack peptidoglycan.
    - **Metabolism**: Some archaea are extremophiles, thriving in extreme conditions such as high temperatures, acidity, or salinity.
    - **Habitats**: Archaea are found in environments like hot springs, deep-sea vents, and the digestive tracts of animals.
    - **Reproduction**: Archaea reproduce asexually through binary fission, similar to bacteria.

1. **Eukarya**:
    - **Cell Type**: Eukaryotes have cells with a membrane-bound nucleus and numerous organelles.
    - **Cell Wall**: While some eukaryotes have cell walls (e.g., plants and fungi), many do not.
    - **Metabolism**: Eukaryotes exhibit diverse metabolic pathways, including aerobic respiration, photosynthesis, and various forms of heterotrophy.
    - **Habitats**: Eukaryotes occupy nearly every terrestrial and aquatic habitat, including oceans, forests, and soils.
    - **Reproduction**: Eukaryotes reproduce both sexually and asexually, with complex life cycles in many species.

Understanding these three domains of life provides a foundation for comprehending the diversity and complexity of living organisms on Earth. While Bacteria and Archaea consist mainly of unicellular microorganisms, Eukarya includes a vast array of life forms, from microscopic protists to multicellular plants, fungi, and animals.
