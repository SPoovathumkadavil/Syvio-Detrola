## Null Hypothesis

There is NO significant difference between the allele/genotype frequencies within the human population.  
OR  
The human population is NOT undergoing evolution in respect to the hair texture trait.  
OR  
The human population IS experiencing genetic equilibrium in respect to the hair texture trait.

## Alternate Hypothesis

There is a significant difference between the allele/genotype frequencies within the human population.  
OR  
The human population is undergoing evolution in respect to the hair texture trait.  
OR  
The human population is NOT experiencing genetic equilibrium in respect to the hair texture trait.

## Claim

The allele/genotype frequencies are NOT in genetic equilibrium  
X^2 = 75.3; X^2 (crit) = 5.99; 75.3>>5.99  
Reject null hypothesis; accept alternative hypothesis
