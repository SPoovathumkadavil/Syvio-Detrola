_Data with a label response_ #Tricky

### Examples of Categorical Data with Labels:
Names, Sex, Age Group, Education Level

### Examples of Categorical Data with Numerical Values: 
Depends on the way the question is presented. #Important
e.g. Generalized responses such as "14-16" or "Around 4"

Also known as qualitative variables, these represent categories or labels and do not have a natural numerical ordering. Examples include gender, color, and type of car.

## **Nominal Variables:** 
Nominal variables represent categories or labels without any inherent order or ranking among them. The categories are distinct and non-numeric. For example, "color" can be a nominal variable with categories like "red," "blue," and "green." The order of these categories is not meaningful; they are simply different labels.
## **Ordinal Variables:** 
Ordinal variables also represent categories, but these categories have a meaningful order or ranking. However, the differences between the categories are not necessarily uniform or quantifiable. An example of an ordinal variable is "educational level," with categories like "high school," "college," and "graduate school." While there's an order (graduate school > college > high school), the difference between these categories is not consistent or measurable in the same way as numerical values.
