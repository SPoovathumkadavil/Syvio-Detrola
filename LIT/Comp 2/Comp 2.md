The 1920s were an interesting time of interesting people. Although people were torn from the effects of the first world war, the economy flourished. Young men, grown accustomed to the war, were concentrated on living in the present. The “Roaring 20s” were the result of the efforts of these radical youth to change society. Parties were commonplace, and many women went to them as well. The scarred youth laughed in the face of prohibition and drank in speakeasies. Fitzgerald relays these elements in his novel, The Great Gatsby. He describes the extent people would go to “have a good time”. He also explores many dark themes such as despair and disillusionment. Considering the setting as the epilogue of a war, it is inferred that many of these people have masks. That they drink and pretend to have fun in order to run away from the despicable nature of their thoughts. Fitzgerald uses elements of modernism such as symbolism, paralysis and the question of the relationship between the past and present to criticize the frivolousness of people in the 1920s.
