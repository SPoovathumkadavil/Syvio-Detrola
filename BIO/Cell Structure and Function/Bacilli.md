_Bacillus_ species are rod-shaped, endospore-forming aerobic or facultatively anaerobic, [[Gram Positive Bacteria|Gram-positive]] bacteria; in some species cultures may turn [[Gram Negative Bacteria|Gram-negative]] with age. The many species of the genus exhibit a wide range of physiologic abilities that allow them to live in every natural environment. Only one [[Endospores|endospore]] is formed per cell. The spores are resistant to heat, cold, radiation, desiccation, and disinfectants. _Bacillus anthracis_ needs oxygen to sporulate; this constraint has important consequences for epidemiology and control. In vivo, _B anthracis_ produces a [[Polypeptides|polypeptide]] (polyglutamic acid) [[Capsule|capsule]] that protects it from phagocytosis. The genera _Bacillus_ and _Clostridium_ constitute the family Bacillaceae. Species are identified by using [[Morphologic Classification of Bacteria|morphologic]] and [[Biochemical Classification of Bacteria|biochemical]] criteria._ [National Library of Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7699/#:~:text=Bacillus%20species%20are%20rod%2Dshaped,turn%20Gram%2Dnegative%20with%20age.)
