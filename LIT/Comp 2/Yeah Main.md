The 1920s—often referred to as the "Roaring 20s"—were a decade marked by profound societal and cultural change. People of this generation struggled to reconcile the horrors of World War One with the promise of economic prosperity. The radical youth grasped the center stage due to their passionate desire to change society. Parties were frequent during the time, drawing both men and women into the revelry of the era. These scarred youth laughed in the face of prohibition and drank in speakeasies. Fitzgerald relays these elements in his novel, The Great Gatsby. He describes the extent people would go to “have a good time”. He also explores many dark themes such as despair and disillusionment. Fitzgerald narrates the prominent masks in the 1920s.   That the newly rich drink and pretend to have fun in order to run away from the despicable nature of their thoughts. Fitzgerald uses elements of modernism such as <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">symbolism</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">paralysis</mark> and the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">question of the relationship between past and present</mark> to criticize the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">frivolousness of people in the 1920s</mark>.

Fitzgerald uses the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">motif of a green light</mark> to embody Jay Gatsby’s <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">connection to his past</mark>. Positioned at the end of Daisy's dock, the green light serves as a symbolic beacon, a constant reminder to Gatsby that Daisy remains just out of reach as long as it continues to shine. Gatsby associates his physical separation from Daisy with his emotional distance from her, as if the light itself holds the key to their reconciliation. He goes to great lengths, even enlisting Nick's assistance, to force situations that will bring them back together. Yet, despite his outward achievements and opulence, Gatsby remains <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">haunted by the past</mark> when he is in Daisy's presence, revealing how the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">frivolity of the era often concealed profound inner turmoil</mark>. He notices now that the green light which he had looked towards with anticipation was now gone. "Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever"(91-92). The significance mentioned ties into Gatsby's ideal of Daisy and it serves to disillusion him from his anachronistic manner. The light is something that Gatsby always looked toward, a perfection that he would always chase. His slight disappointment is shown through the description of the significance of the light fading: "His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one."(91-92). This account brings attention to the value of the green light itself to Gatsby. The realization that Gatsby's collection of "enchanted objects" is dwindling by one illustrates the brief nature of his goals, much like the 1920s' fleeting allure of expensive parties and material excesses. Although Gatsby's stated objective is to get nearer to Daisy, he is also lured to the fantasy of relentlessly pursuing her, which reflects the tendency of the time to place a higher value on the chase of idealized fantasies than genuine ties. Gatsby's obsession with the green light  exposes the hollowness of frivolous pursuits, reflecting the novel's overall rebuke of the ideals of the time.

Fitzgerald's writing sheds light on the superficiality of desires and dreams in the 1920s. The depiction of Jay Gatsby's bedroom provides an intriguing setting for exploring the intricate relationship between material possessions and individual identity. One specific component stands out as parts of Gatsby's home are introduced: "His bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold."(91-92) The decor's dullness captures Gatsby's intriguing and elusive personality. Even though he is surrounded by excess and ostentation, his personal space exudes discretion and moderation. The toilet made of pure dull gold. This contrast in his home emphasizes the novel's emphasis on materialism and gives a glimpse into the nature of his personality, where the temptation of money coexists with an underlying feeling of yearning and unfulfilled dreams. One way Gatsby attempts to court Daisy is through displaying his wardrobe. "He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before us..."(91-92). Gatsby's excessive display of a variety of expensive shirts is a reflection of the Jazz Age's hedonistic indulgences. These shirts are an example of the superficial interests of the time because of their extreme diversity and grandeur, which were intended to dazzle Daisy. The way Gatsby attempts to capture Daisy's affections is shown by the act of tossing the shirts into a vibrant jumble, highlighting the shallowness of his outlook on happiness and love. Daisy has an emotional reaction to Gatsby's act of throwing his shirts: "They’re such beautiful shirts [...] It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such beautiful shirts before"(91-92). The frivolity of her desires and her yearning for material fortune are revealed by her tears and her declaration of the shirts' beauty. Daisy's response represents the 1920s' obsession with consumerism and the allure of luxury. She is brought to tears by the excessive show of money rather than by love or sincere feeling. Her voice was muffled by the shirts, a representation of how her preoccupation with worldly goals hides her emotional complexity.
