[[SNP]] - Single Nucleotide Polymorphism

New sequence because DNA replication error.

1. Two strands have to separate first.
	1. AACG, TTGC
2. Create new strands in middle, Anti parallel.
3. If G paired with a T on one strand, if the other strand formed perfectly
	1. One good copy, the other has mismatched base pair.
		1. Mistakes can be made.
	2. G has 2 ring structure, usually pairs with single ring structure, C.
		1. T also has single ringed structure.
	3. The machine makes a mistake, makes sense and works in place.
	4. Copying happens in the same cell, but now because of mutation, one cell has DNA that looks like original, while other has mistake in it.
	5. Either can end up with mistake. 3D.

 4. When this cell splits, one is good, the other has the mistake.
