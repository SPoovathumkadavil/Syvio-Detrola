Governed by the #Covenant , theocracy, Puritans wanted to come to the new world to rebel against the persecution they faced in Europe. Dissident? 

Going further, they wanted to secure their own religion on top.

Depravity := They thought people were sinful (Original Sin).
Original Sin := Sinfulness that came from Adam and Eve and the knowledge tree.
- Returning to the Garden of Eden -- Undo the original sin.
- Free Will := Why did God not stop people from committing sin?
	- People are free to choose, but God ordained the fall.

Covenant := A legal contract with God, a promise

Election/Predestination := If chosen, then it will happen. Most people go to hell. God already knows.
- Notion that god loves the elect and God shows mercy in the form of Jesus who sacrifices.

City upon a hill
- Look at the puritans in America, they are doing it right.
- 17th and 18th century.

## Johnathan Edwards -- 1703-1758

Spiders and stuff

Idealist, studied ideas and became a preacher and um preached at this place in Massachusetts.
Most of the puritan stuff happened in Massachusetts.
Worked with indigenous.
Became president of Princeton.

Dialectical thinking -- Rebellion, pendulum shift that the puritans react to liberalism by becoming conservative, so they go to new world ...

"The New England Way"

"The Greatest American Philosopher"

## Sermon

Emotions, Idealism to Material
Repetition, How to shape message to make it persuasive.

Very provocative.
"They have no refuge"

Awakening unconverted.

Misery is extended under you, pit of wrath of god.
You have nothing to stand on.
Nothing but air.
God holds you up.

Your means are nothing.
If God wills it, so be it.
You would sink despite righteousness.

Light to serve sin and satan.
The air does not serve you when you are among god's "enemy"
Restraining hand of God.

Rise higher until outlet is given.
Your guilt increases.
The waters rise, [Materialism]
Inconcevable fury

Justice bends the arrow towards your heart.
Those not awakened, you are in the hands of an angry god.
It doesn't matter if you follow god, you have to be Puritan.

You could have been gone.
An everlasting wrath

More individualistic, individually choose morality

Liberal Puritans
