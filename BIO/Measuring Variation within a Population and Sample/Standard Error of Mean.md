The Standard Deviation of the means
Standard error ofÂ the mean (SEM) measures how far the sample mean (average) of the data is likely to be from the true population mean. The SEM is always smaller than the SD.
# How to calculate
$$\large\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$
$$\large \sqrt\frac{\dfrac{\sum (x_i -\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}{n}$$
