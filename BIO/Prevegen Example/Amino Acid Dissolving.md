# Amino Acids Entering The Stomach
[[Amino Acids]] are "folded" into some 3-D shape that gives it the specific characteristic. When the protein enters your stomach, it dissolves and "unravels". In this process, they are [[Denatured Amino Acids|denatured]].
After the shape is lost, the amino acid is broken down into molecular building frameworks.
