ATP Hydrolysis
- If you hydrolyze ATP, you can remove 3rd Phosphate Group
- The release of energy (thermal) is not usable
- Cell respiration releases energy to the surroundings
- **Phosphorylation**: The addition of a phosphate group to some molecule.
	- When you add energy, the molecule is more unstable.
	- Phosphate group has a negative charge associated with it.
	- Negatively charged particles added to molecule with its oen negative charges(electrons).
	- The shape of the molecule change!!! when the phosphate group is added.

A) How does the addition of a phosphate group to Pho4 contribute to its activation as a catalyst?
- Pho4 does not change chemically, only facilitates the transfer of the phosphate group.
- Phosphorylation is **anabolic**/endergonic, It is building.
	- Pho4-P + ADP is the product, NOT Pho4 + P.
		- Pho4 + ATP are the reactions

D) Why might DePho by Pho5 be faster than Pho by Pho4
- CATABOLIC BRUHHHHH
	- Activation energy barrier is lower, bro :0
- Read the question next time.

E) What is the effect of CaCO2 Treatment?
- Adding CaCO2 means less phosphorus, meaning less ATP. Less ATP means less phosphorylized
