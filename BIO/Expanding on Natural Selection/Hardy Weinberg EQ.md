A little review from middle school life science...

_(You may want to write this down...)_

An **allele** is one (1) version of a gene. A gene, composed of DNA, is often considered to serve as the instructions for making a protein within a cell. Thus, one allele could serve as the instructions to make one version of a protein, a second allele could be used to make a different version, and so on.

A **genotype** is the genetic make-up of an individual. Every one inherits one (1) allele (i.e. version of a gene) from each of their parents.

Genotypes for a single gene come in three (3) different forms: **homozygous dominant** (AA; you have inherited two dominant alleles from your parents), **heterozygous** (Aa; you have inherited one dominant and one recessive allele from your parents), and **homozygous recessive** (aa; you have inherited two recessive alleles from your parents).![[Screenshot 2023-10-05 at 8.21.26 AM.png]]![[Screenshot 2023-10-05 at 8.20.11 AM.png]]![[Screenshot 2023-10-05 at 8.22.09 AM.png]]
