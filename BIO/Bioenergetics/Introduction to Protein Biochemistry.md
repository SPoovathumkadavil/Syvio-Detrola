## Protein Structures
Intra-Molecular Interactions: Interaction **within** the molecule
- 2nd Secondary Structures
- 3rd Tertiary Structures
	- Need to be here to function
	- **Must** adopt 3D structure to be functional
Inter-Molecular Interactions: Interaction **between** molecules.
- 4th Quaternary Structures
	- Atl. Two Protein Present!

Kinetic energy of the system lowers at lower temps
- Change in react
