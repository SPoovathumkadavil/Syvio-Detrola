## Review
Protein is folded chain of amino acids linked by peptide bonds.
Dehydration responsible for synthesis is endergonic.
The tertiary structure is caused by the side-groups of different amino acids.
These side groups can be acidic/basic (charged), polar, or non-polar.
A change in pH or temperature can affect these interactions leading to denaturation.

Denaturation is a continuum, can be relatively denatured.

Charge-Charge interactions between enzyme and substrate
Polar-Polar: Hydrogen bonds form as a result of polar or partially polar parts of molecules.
Non polar Interactions.

Substrate: Ligands

More than one interaction available between enzyme and substrate.

Affinity: How well do the enzyme and substrate interact

A protein could bind to multiple types of substrates.

The substrate could conform to an enzyme such that a reaction could occur due to the catalysis by the enzyme.

If a substrate causes an irreversible interaction with an enzyme, that enzyme has been inhibited. The enzyme cannot catalyze anything else because it is inhibited by whatever is in its active site.

If there is an incredible fit between enzyme and substrate and the product cannot be released this causes inhibition.

"This is how drugs work, folks"

eg. Ibuprofen inhibits the enzymes that might be causing pain.

If increased affinity of enzyme, the reaction rate is increased.

If higher affinity, less concentration is needed to produce a higher reaction rate.

### Hemoglobin
Primary transport of oxygen from the respiratory system to body cells.

There are different types, fetal v. adult.
