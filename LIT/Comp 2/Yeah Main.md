The 1920s—often referred to as the "Roaring 20s"—were a decade marked by profound societal and cultural change. People of this generation struggled to reconcile the horrors of World War One with the promise of economic prosperity. The radical youth grasped the center stage due to their passionate desire to change society. Parties were frequent during the time, drawing both men and women into the revelry of the era. These scarred youth laughed in the face of prohibition and drank in speakeasies. Fitzgerald relays these elements in his novel, The Great Gatsby. He describes the extent people would go to “have a good time”. He also explores many dark themes such as despair and disillusionment. Fitzgerald narrates the prominent masks in the 1920s.   That the newly rich drink and pretend to have fun in order to run away from the despicable nature of their thoughts. Fitzgerald uses elements of modernism such as symbolism, paralysis and the question of the relationship between past and present to criticize the frivolousness of people in the 1920s.

Fitzgerald uses the motif of a green light to embody Jay Gatsby’s connection to his past. Positioned at the end of Daisy's dock, the green light serves as a symbolic beacon, a constant reminder to Gatsby that Daisy remains just out of reach as long as it continues to shine. Gatsby associates his physical separation from Daisy with his emotional distance from her, as if the light itself holds the key to their reconciliation. He goes to great lengths, even enlisting Nick's assistance, to force situations that will bring them back together. Yet, despite his outward achievements and opulence, Gatsby remains haunted by the past when he is in Daisy's presence, revealing how the frivolity of the era often concealed profound inner turmoil. He notices now that the green light which he had looked towards with anticipation was now gone. "Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever"(91-92). The significance mentioned ties into Gatsby's ideal of Daisy and it serves to disillusion him from his anachronistic manner. The light is something that Gatsby always looked toward, a perfection that he would always chase. His slight disappointment is shown through the description of the significance of the light fading: "His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one."(91-92). This account brings attention to the value of the green light itself to Gatsby. The realization that Gatsby's collection of "enchanted objects" is dwindling by one illustrates the brief nature of his goals, much like the 1920s' fleeting allure of expensive parties and material excesses. Although Gatsby's stated objective is to get nearer to Daisy, he is also lured to the fantasy of relentlessly pursuing her, which reflects the tendency of the time to place a higher value on the chase of idealized fantasies than genuine ties. Gatsby, with his quest to get closer to Daisy now accomplished, feels an ironic confusion. '“It’s the funniest thing, old sport,” he said hilariously. “I can’t—When I try to—”'(91-92). Gatsby's amusing but disjointed attempt to express himself reveals a more profound emotional barrier and the struggle to express his feelings. The sensation of immobility is representative of the larger subject of emotional restraint and internal conflict that pervades modernist literature, where characters frequently struggle with the difficulties of their own desires and histories as well as the constraints of their own ability to express themselves. Gatsby's obsession with the green light exposes the hollowness of frivolous pursuits, reflecting the novel's overall rebuke of the ideals of the time.

Fitzgerald's writing sheds light on the superficiality of desires and dreams in the 1920s. The depiction of Jay Gatsby's bedroom provides an intriguing setting for exploring the intricate relationship between material possessions and individual identity. One specific component stands out as parts of Gatsby's home are introduced: "His bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold."(91-92) The decor's dullness relates to Gatsby's intriguing introduction. Even though he is surrounded by excess and ostentation, his personal space exudes discretion and moderation. This discretion is juxtaposed by the toilet made of pure dull gold. This contrast in his home stresses the novel's emphasis on materialism and gives a glimpse into the nature of his personality, where the temptation of money coexists with an underlying feeling of yearning and unfulfilled dreams. One way Gatsby attempts to court Daisy is through displaying his wardrobe. "He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before us..."(91-92). Gatsby's excessive display of a variety of expensive shirts is a reflection of the Jazz Age's hedonistic indulgences. These shirts are an example of the superficial interests of the time because of their extreme diversity and grandeur, which were intended to dazzle Daisy. The way Gatsby attempts to capture Daisy's affections is shown by the act of tossing the shirts into a vibrant jumble, highlighting the shallowness of his outlook on happiness and love. Daisy has an emotional reaction to Gatsby's act of throwing his shirts: "They’re such beautiful shirts [...] It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such beautiful shirts before"(91-92). The frivolity of her desires and her yearning for material fortune are revealed by her tears and her declaration of the shirts' beauty. Daisy's response represents the 1920s' obsession with consumerism and the allure of luxury. She is brought to tears by the excessive show of money rather than by love or sincere feeling. Her voice was muffled by the shirts, a representation of how her preoccupation with worldly goals hides her emotional complexity. These depictions and activities provide a powerful commentary on the emptiness that can accompany the chase of riches and luxury, illustrating the overriding theme of materialistic pursuits dominating deeper human connections and genuine aspirations.

The frivolousness that Fitzgerald highlights in his work not only applies to the 1920s, but even today. "The Great Gatsby" explores the idea of the American Dream and how the pursuit of monetary prosperity can corrupt it. Disillusionment results from Gatsby's determined pursuit of his own version of the American Dream, symbolized by his love for Daisy. This novel encourages readers to consider the nature of their own goals and the possible repercussions of pursuing an idealistic concept of success.
