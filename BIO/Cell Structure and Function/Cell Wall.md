_**All prokaryotic cells have a stiff cell wall, located underneath the capsule**Â (if there is one). This structure maintains the cell's shape, protects the cell interior, and prevents the cell from bursting when it takes up water._ [Kahn Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/gene-expression-and-regulation/dna-and-rna-structure/a/prokaryote-structure#:~:text=The%20cell%20wall,when%20it%20takes%20up%20water.)
