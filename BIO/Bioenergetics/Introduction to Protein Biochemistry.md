## Protein Structures
Intra-Molecular Interactions: Interaction **within** the molecule
- 2nd Secondary Structures
- 3rd Tertiary Structures
	- Need to be here to function
	- **Must** adopt 3D structure to be functional
Inter-Molecular Interactions: Interaction **between** molecules.
- 4th Quaternary Structures
	- Atl. Two Protein Present!

## Can denature into more or less active at higher or lower temps?
Kinetic energy of the system lowers at lower temps
- Change in reaction rate can be attributed to this
	- Even in protein enzyme catalyst things.
- Less temp, less kinetic energy, less interactions.

## The Side Group, the 'R' Group
The only different thing in the structure of an amino acid
- Amino Acid and Carboxyl Are Always Present

### Leucine vs Serine
![[Screenshot 2023-12-04 at 8.57.18â€¯AM.png]]
_Leucine_
- More complex?
- Non-Polar side chain / Hydrophobic side group
	- Carbon Hydrogen Bonds
_Serine_
- Polar Covalent Bond
	- Hydroxyl Group
	- Oxygen is slightly pulling more than the Hydrogen, slight difference in charge.
		- Water is polar, the oxygen is more electronegative than the hydrogen.
			- The Hydrogen Bond in this case is the Intermolecular force between the H from the Serine and the O from the water.
- Polar / Hydrophilic

[Hydrogen Bond]: An attraction, but not a covalent connection.
- Individually Weak, but

### How do these fold?
_Leucine_:
_Serine_: 

## How do Amino Acids Bond?
The Carboxyl group of one and Amine group of another are combined.

**The Side Chains are Not Involved in Bonding, Though they are relevant in folding.**
