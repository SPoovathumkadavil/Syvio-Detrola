The 1920s—often referred to as the "Roaring 20s"—were a decade marked by profound societal and cultural change. People of this generation struggled to reconcile the horrors of World War One with the promise of economic prosperity. The radical youth grasped the center stage due to their passionate desire to change society. Parties were frequent during the time, drawing both men and women into the revelry of the era. These scarred youth laughed in the face of prohibition and drank in speakeasies. Fitzgerald relays these elements in his novel, The Great Gatsby. He describes the extent people would go to “have a good time”. He also explores many dark themes such as despair and disillusionment. Fitzgerald narrates the prominent masks in the 1920s.   That the newly rich drink and pretend to have fun in order to run away from the despicable nature of their thoughts. Fitzgerald uses elements of modernism such as symbolism, paralysis and the question of the relationship between past and present to criticize the frivolousness of people in the 1920s.

Fitzgerald uses the motif of a green light to embody Gatsby’s stagnation and yearning. Positioned at the end of Daisy's dock, the green light serves as a symbolic beacon, a constant reminder to Gatsby that Daisy remains just out of reach as long as it continues to shine. Gatsby associates his physical separation from Daisy with his emotional distance from her, as if the light itself holds the key to their reconciliation. He goes to great lengths, even enlisting Nick's assistance, to force situations that will bring them back together. Yet, despite his outward achievements and opulence, Gatsby remains haunted by the past when he is in Daisy's presence, paralyzed by his own history. He notices now that the green light which he had looked towards with anticipation was now gone. "Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever"(91-92). The significance mentioned ties into Gatsby's ideal of Daisy and it serves to disillusion him his anachronistic manner. 

This highlights how even seemingly insignificant concerns from one's past can interfere with the present, impeding the efforts of even the most determined individuals.
