In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the [[mean]] (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

## The Empirical Rule
The image below shows parts of the graph covered by venturing out particular standard deviations. For example, +/- 1SD would cover about 67% of the [[Population|population]], while +/- 2SD covers about 95%.

## Calculation

Standard Deviation is calculated by performing a square root operation on the [[Variance|variance]] of the data. In full form it would look like this $\large\sigma$ Being the Standard Deviation itself: 

$$\large \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(x_i-\bar{x})}^2}{n-1}}$$
$$\large \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum{(x_i-\bar{x})}^2}{n-1}$$
Check [[Variance|variance explanation]] for more detail on the right side of the equation.
