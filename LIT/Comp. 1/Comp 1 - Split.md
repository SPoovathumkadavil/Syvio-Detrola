# Prompt

identify a story that your text tells about America/Americans.

# Intro

## Hook

The Treaty With the Delawares signed on September 17, 1778 reveals an often forgotten fragment of America—a tale of diplomacy, strife, and shared destiny.

## Background 2

From the time of the events in 1778 onward, the government has continuously put pressure on Native Americans. The Homestead Act, which allowed any adult American to own property in the west for just $10, was adopted by the United States in 1862. White settlers descended onto Native American settlements lured by the land and began a slaughter that claimed thousands of native lives. Government officials in the United States declared that Indians needed to be eliminated or relocated to desolate areas. They believed "only dead Indians are good Indians." Native Americans were slaughtered by American troops who considered it as normal and even an honor to kill Indians(Chinese Foreign Affairs). 

## Background 3

During the 19th century, when most natives were in reservations, the US government enforced cultural assimilation of native children. This involved boarding schools that these children were forced into. These children were stripped of their names, beliefs and anything that made them Native American. Children sent to these boarding schools were often separated from their families and leased to white families as indentured servants(Equal Justice Initiative).

## Background 4

Much of America's sentiment toward Native Americans during the time of the treaty can be recalled through Michael Cresap's story. Cresap was a colonist from Maryland who took part in armed conflict west of the Proclamation of 1763, the British-established boundary for America. In 1772, Shawnee Indians were seeking to retake the Fort Pitt when colonists in the fort waged war against them. When Cresap and his soldiers learned of this, they went to the Ohio River to kill two innocent Native Americans who were canoe fishing. This incident encouraged further settlers to join them in the senseless act of killing Indians. This bloodshed set off a prolonged summer of bloody struggle that is now known as Dunmore's war. Once the bloodshed ceased, Cresap and his men were regarded brutes who partook in unnecessary violence. Sentiment around the group changed, however, as they marched toward Lexington and Concord. This news was controlled by the continental press to fabricate the idea of savagery for their own good.(Anti-Indian Propaganda, Smith, Cole)

## Thesis Pre

The same Continental Congress that humanized Cresap's violence had gone to the belittled Natives in their time of need. The treaty with the Delawares is the result of this necessity. The Lenape people were persuaded to relocate from their ancestral homes to regions in present-day Pittsburgh and Detroit. 

## Thesis

It is ingrained in American culture that the process of securing one's own freedom often involves disregarding the freedom of others.

# Body Paragraph #1

## Topic Sentence

When America confronted Natives in the east, it took to a throne of lies.

## Evidence 1 with Lead-In

The treaty with the Delawares upraised the Lenape people, giving then impressions of friendship and equal footing. This could not have been further from the truth as the United States made unfulfilled promises for protection. During the American Revolution, native tribes were forced to pick sides among the United States and the British. Many tended to ally with the British, knowing first-hand the cruelty of intruding colonists. Article one of the treaty stated no hard feelings, that "offenses or acts of hostility...mutually forgiven"(Treaty with the Delawares, 1778).

## Analysis 1

The juxtaposition between the words and predicament of the United States show deeper meaning to this seemingly reciprocal behavior. Although America claims friendship and peace with the Delawares, anti-Indian sentiment was continually on the rise. America is willing to temporarily disregard the differences between the colonists and Indians to secure independence from the British. This individualistic behavior is commonly seen throughout America's history and it plays an important role in the forming of it's moral compass. The Delaware people were still attacked without question in 1782 by Pennsylvanian militia. 

## Evidence 2 with Lead-In

One of the more impactful clauses of the treaty was to provide the Delawares statehood, for tribes "to join the present confederation, and to form a state whereof the Delaware nation shall be the head, and have a representation in Congress"(Treaty With the Delawares, 1778)

## Analysis 2

Strictly speaking, this was a truly revolutionary idea. Coincidentally, this was one of many clauses completely undermined by the United States. After the death of one of the Native American signers of the treaty, the air around the treaty completely changed. As the Delaware people raised their grievances about their allegedly killed signer, the Continental Congress proceeded to ignore them. In March of 1782, Pennsylvanian militia killed around 96 Delaware natives who returned to their homes. They returned to salvage what they could from the rubble left behind from the British who ransacked their homes.(Zotigh, 2018)

## Concluding Sentence

Human nature itself can be inferred from the actions of the United States as it developed a need to focus on one's own freedom while denying rights to perceived unequals.

# Body Paragraph #2 

## Thesis

The language used in the Treaty With the Delawares provide powerful connotation to the intentions and approach of the United Stated in regards to Native Americans.

## Evidence 1 with Lead-In

The writers made it seem like the Native Americans were getting mutual protection or benefit from the deal, claiming "...then that each shall assist the other in due proportion to their ability..."(Treaty With the Delawares, 1778). The Natives were also promised "that a fort of sufficient strength and capacity be built at the expense of the said States"(Treaty With the Delawares, 1778)

## Analysis

The protection that the Natives were hoping for never arrived, forcing most to flee from the British invasion in the east. The statement of the 'State's expense' hints at the power dynamics at play between the United States and Native Tribes. Natives often received immense pressure and had limited leverage when negotiating. The tone of the text implies 'American generosity' through these giving of 'gifts'. This excerpt is from Article III, the longest article in the treaty. This article consists of all that is expected from the Delawares during wartime, including free passage and care for American soldiers. This shows the objective of the treaty, to secure support during the Revolutionary War.

## Evidence 2 with Lead-In

The wording of the treaty also introduced it's own purpose as that of eternal peace, clarifying "...for the better peace and friendship now entered into by contracting parties..."(Treaty With the Delawares, 1778)

## Analysis 2

By referencing the 'common good', the writers take the edge off the commanding tone of Article III. By following up right after the promise of the fort, the writers aimed to create a sense of inclusion to the natives, though they were treated as expendable support for their troops.
