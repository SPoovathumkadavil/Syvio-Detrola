New species can emerge when one pop splits into two or more reproductivly isolated cells.

Generic variation can appear at random in each of these isolated populations over time (ie. over several generations)

Natural selection can act on the variations present in one or more of these isolated populations leading to a unique accumulation of changes over time.

The populations may become very different from one another but will share a common ancestral population / species.

The common ancestor, one, or both or even all three of these species could be driven to extinction of the environment changes. Survival is never guaranteed.

We can infer how closely related two species are to one another through a study of their anatomical, physiological, molecular, and/or behavioral characteristics.

Fertilized eggs 46 DNA. 23 from sperm 23 from egg.
Every cell derived form it should have 46 DNA molecules.

We can infor how closely related two species are to one another through a study of their anatomical, physiological, molecular, and/or behavior charactatristics.

What if a mistake takes place in the formation of sperm cells?
- Extra?
- Less?

What leads to infertile offspring?
- form of isolation
- 23 DNA Egg, Abnormal DNA Sperm
	- 45 || 47
		- DNA Has to form pairs to form sex cells.
		- Immature eggs are present from birth
		- The extra stops the production
			- What if there is 23 || 24 male?
- Reproductively isolated subpopulation within the population.
