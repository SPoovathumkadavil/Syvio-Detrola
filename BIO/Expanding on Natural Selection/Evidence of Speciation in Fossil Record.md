- **Formation of Fossils**
    - Fossils form through mineralization of buried organism remains over millions of years.
    - Various factors, including sediment type and environmental conditions, influence fossilization.

- **Transitional Fossils**
    - Transitional fossils exhibit traits of both ancestral and descendant species, providing direct evidence of evolutionary change.
    - They bridge the gap between species, supporting evolutionary relationships.

- **Examples of Transitional Fossils**
    - _Archaeopteryx_: A classic transitional fossil showing characteristics of both reptiles and birds, supporting the theory of avian evolution from reptilian ancestors.

- **Stratigraphy**
    - Stratigraphy studies the geological layers (strata) where fossils are found to establish relative ages of fossils.
    - Helps construct timelines of species existence and evolutionary changes.

- **Mass Extinctions**
    - Fossil records document periods of mass extinctions when numerous species disappear.
    - Such events create ecological opportunities for surviving species, leading to diversification.

- **Patterns of Evolution**
    - Fossils reveal patterns of gradual evolution, where species change incrementally, and punctuated evolution, with rapid changes.
    - These patterns help understand the tempo of evolutionary processes.

- **Challenges in the Fossil Record**
    - The fossil record is incomplete, as many organisms do not fossilize or their fossils deteriorate.
    - Bias exists toward species with hard shells or bones, resulting in gaps in the record.

- **Paleontology**
    - Paleontology is the scientific field dedicated to studying fossils and reconstructing the history of life on Earth.
    - Paleontologists play a crucial role in deciphering evolutionary history.

- **Contributions to Evolutionary Theory**
    - Charles Darwin used fossil evidence as a key component of his theory of evolution by natural selection.
