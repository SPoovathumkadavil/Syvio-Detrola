Antibiotics attack [[Prokaryotic Cells|prokaryotes]], bacteria, not our own [[Eukaryotic Cells|eukaryotic cells]].

## Antibiotic Resistance and [[Natural Selection]]
Natural variety even in same species. [[Fitness|Natural fitness]] is there.  Overtime, higher fitness 
Evolution(change over time), natural selection is mechanism.
The allele could still be recessive
Carriers are heterozygous recessive.
If env does not change, then mean shift.
Mutations are random.
Positive and negative effects.
Pos - May have more babies than. average - adaptation
overtime, more babies with that gene, more frequent.
There is variation in bacteria. DNA replication error
When antibiotics are taken then env. changes.
The living have fitness and can reproduce more.
When competition is killed off, easy replication without worry.
Conjugation -> Bacteria can share genes with each other
Natural selection available shortly, so evolution can occur.
Never ending antibiotic marathon
Important to only take antibiotics for bacterial infection.
Zone of inhibition
**the colonies were always there, not made**
Variations are heritable
Individuals don't evolve, populations do
Variation must already exist, so they survive to reproduce and pass on their genes.
