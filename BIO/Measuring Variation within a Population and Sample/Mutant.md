Mutants in data are **outliers**. Normally, in physics or chemistry, we simply ignore or delete these values. Not in Biology or Statistics. These values are important reminders of variance.

Think of someone who is immune to Covid-19. They are extremely rare and on one side of a [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]]. These are really special people and you would be drawn to their rare trait.
Similarly, think of the opposite. Someone who has severe disposition from the slightest exposure to Covid-19. Are these people not part of our overall population just because they fit the extremes?
