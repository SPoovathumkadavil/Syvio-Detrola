_Biochemical reactions can reveal the vital information necessary for accurately identifying the genera of various bacteria within a sample. By their nature, bacteria produce large volumes of enzymes, and it is these enzymes that allow for their identification via biochemical methods. The type of enzymes produced by a bacterium can usually be used to classify its species given that bacteria have distinct enzymatic profiles.

Each species of bacteria has specific metabolic needs and relies on different enzymes to fuel those unique needs. The presence of catalase, [[Gelatinase|gelatinase]], oxidase, urease, for example, can be used to identify the species of bacteria.

Biochemical reactions used in biochemical tests depend on the presence of such bacteria. Such biochemical tests have been designed to measure the levels of bacterial enzymes which can be interpreted to accurately identify the species of bacteria they have been produced by._
