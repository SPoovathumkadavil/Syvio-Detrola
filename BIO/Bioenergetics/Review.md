ATP Hydrolysis
- If you hydrolyze ATP, you can remove 3rd Phosphate Group
- The release of energy (thermal) is not usable
- Cell respiration releases energy to the surroundings
- Phosphorylation: The addition of a phosphate group to some molecule.
	- When you add energy, the molecule is more unstable.
	- Phosphate group has a negative charge associated with it.
	- Negatively charged particles added to molecule with its oen negative charges(electrons).
	- The shape of the molecule change!!! when the phosphate group is added.

A) How does the addition of a phosphate group to Pho4 contribute to its activation as a catalyst?
- Pho4 does not change chemically, only facilitates the transfer of the phosphate group.
- Phosphorillation is anabolic
