[[Prokaryotic Cells|Prokaryotic]], cause health and disease, Live on skin and objects around us
Bacteria live within organisms as well. For example, our large intestine is a bacterial ecosystem with at least dozens of unique species taking residence.
Eukaryotic more complex
no nucleus or membrane bound organelles like Mitochondria, E. R., Golgi Complexes
Cell envolope - layers
cell wall - outer surface, protection, contains peptidoglycan (determines gram positive or gram negative) If peptidoglycan is above the plasma membrane, it can retain dye. Negative bacteria have thinner layer sandwiched between surface membrane and plasma membranes. These cant retain dye
"Gram staining"
![[Cell Wall Variable Shapes | center | 1000]]
E-Coli are rod shaped bacilli
Some bacteria are covered by capsule(outermost layer), these act as shields to adhere and protect. Virulence factor
Phagocytosis is often performed by white blood cells called phagocytes, cells that are part of the non-specific immune response.
Plasma membrane innermost most important. Contains cytoplasm which is water, cell components, enzymes, molecules. 
If no membrane, contents spill.
Plasma membrane is responsible for communication with outside world. Aquire nutieients eliminate waste, mamahe constant organized state
selectivly permeable, respiration, photosynthesis, systhesis of lipids and cell comonents.
There are species of bacteria that perform photosynthesis. ALL cells perform a version of cellular respiration.
In cytoplasm there are ribosomes, sites of protein synthesis. if in cytoplasm free, Make proteins that stay in the cell, if attached on the plasma membrane, make proteins for cell and outside. The second kind is called Plasma membrane associated robosomes.
Nucleoid contains chromozomes, mostly single circle ds-DNA. Some can have linear & more than one chromosome. 
plasmids Small ds-DNA that are independant, Cna be circular or linear few genes, not nessesary, usually confer selective advantages such as resistance to antibiotics.
Bacteria can more or attach itself to other surfaces, they have pili, hair like surfaces, fimbriae(smaller hairs). Can have flagella, tail like thing for movement. ![[prokaryotic cell.jpg | center | 1000]]
