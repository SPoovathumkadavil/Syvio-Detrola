## Formal Definition
A variable is a characteristic or property that can take on different values or levels for different individuals or units within a dataset. It is a fundamental concept used to _quantify and describe_ the diversity and variability among the elements being studied. Variables can be classified into two main types: [[Categorical Data]] and [[Quantitative Data]]

Variables are the building blocks of data analysis, and statistical techniques are applied to these variables to gain insights, make predictions, and draw conclusions about the phenomena being studied.
